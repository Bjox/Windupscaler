# Windupscaler
A small and lightweight tool to make applications run in a borderless mode, using integer upscaling and without any image filtering. Useful for playing old games that only support low resolutions, or for playing games at a lower than native resolution without any filtering associated with playing in fullscreen.

### Features (work in progress)
- List all currently open windows.
- Choose between borderless-fullscreen (stretch), borderless-fullscreen (keep aspect-ratio), or a custom size.
- Command line options in order to automatically start and scale an application.
